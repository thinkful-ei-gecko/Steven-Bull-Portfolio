            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <div class="aboutMe">
              <p>
                I am a current apprentice for Thinkful in the Engineering Immersion program.
                I love the smell of strong coffee in front of a computer monitor in the morning,
                and I love solving problems and squashing bugs even more.
                The endorphin rush I experience whenever I finally publish a project can rival any adrenaline junkie’s high.
                I enjoy learning new things and breaking everything while putting those new things into practice. 
              </p>
              <p>
                When I’m not in front of a computer monitor, I can be found spending time 
                with my wife and three (large) dogs or binge-watching various types of 
                documentaries on Netflix. 
                My current one-year learning goals (beyond coding) are the piano and the 
                Spanish language. Maybe if Spanish were a computer language, 
                I could learn it quicker than I currently am…

            <p>This section will be deleted. The About Me, Skills, and 
              Projects sections will be expandable buttons that will show
              their content. This will keep my page simple and elegant.
              The colors I will go with will be whites and blacks/grays.
